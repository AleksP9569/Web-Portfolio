                                <p> The objective of this project was to design a 4-element microstrip patch linear antenna array 
                                    operating at 5.2 GHz. The design comprises a 4-element patch array with a microstrip feedline 
                                    network, matched to a 50-ohm input port. Various radiation patterns were measured and 
                                    analyzed to evaluate the antenna's performance. The design process began with hardware and 
                                    software preparation. RT/Duroid 5880 was selected as the substrate material, and AWR 
                                    Microwave Office along with MATLAB was used for simulation and validation. The initial step 
                                    involved designing a single microstrip patch element, which was replicated four times to form 
                                    the array. Subsequently, the microstrip feed network was developed, and all components were 
                                    integrated into a final layout for fabrication.

                            </div>

                           

                          

                            
                            <div class="home-content info">
                                
                                

                                <p> The entire design process, including simulation, refinement, and optimization, was conducted 
                                    in AWR Microwave Office. The first step was designing the individual radiating element, which 
                                    was then duplicated to form the array. The microstrip feed network was similarly simulated and 
                                    optimized. MATLAB was used to validate critical calculations during this stage. After completing 
                                    the optimization process, the final design was consolidated into a single copper layout using 
                                    AWR software. The design was then exported as a Gerber (.ger) file for fabrication.

                                <p> The final implementation phase involved testing the antenna array using a Vector Network 
                                    Analyzer (VNA) and measuring radiation patterns in an anechoic chamber. Return loss was first 
                                    measured by connecting the array to the VNA. Next, the array was aligned with a radiating horn 
                                    antenna in the anechoic chamber. Using a mechanical rotating device, data for all possible 
                                    polarization states were collected to ensure measurement accuracy. When the polarizations 
                                    were matched, the results confirmed the antenna performed as designed.

                                <p> The design, simulation, and testing of the 4-element microstrip patch linear antenna array were 
                                    successfully completed. The integration of AWR Microwave Office and MATLAB proved 
                                    effective in optimizing the design and ensuring precision in the feed network and radiating 
                                    elements. Laboratory measurements validated the antenna's performance, demonstrating 
                                    expected results in return loss and radiation patterns. This project highlights the feasibility of 
                                    designing compact and efficient microstrip patch arrays for high-frequency applications  
                                    for adaptation in wireless communication systems.
