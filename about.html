                                <p> With a strong foundation in both electrical engineering and high-performance athletics, 
                                    I am well-accustomed to perseverance and thrive on tackling challenges head-on. 
                                    Having spent 17 years honing my skills in swimming, including 10 years competing at the Canadian National Level, 
                                    overcoming adversity has become second nature to me. During my five years as a swimmer at the University of Ottawa, 
                                    I not only earned multiple <span>conference medals</span> but also played a pivotal role in helping the university secure its <span>first-ever national banner</span>. 
                                    This experience has solidified my commitment to excellence, both in the pool and beyond. Excellence in motion—unwavering and relentless.

                                   Outside of work, I have a wide range of passions that fuel my <span>curiosity and creativity </span>.

									playing soccer, watching movies, swimming, and stargazing. In short, the thrill of <span>exploration</span>—whether 
									through physical adventure, intellectual pursuits, or creative endeavors—never ceases to amaze and enthrall me.
									These passions constantly push me to <span>explore</span> new frontiers, whether in the world around me or within myself, 
									and they provide me with a wellspring of inspiration and fulfillment that I carry with me every day.
