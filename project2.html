                        <p> This project focused on designing and constructing an RF amplifier operating at 3.0 GHz using 
                            the NPN BJT transistor AT-42086. The design process began with paper-based schematics, 
                            followed by simulation, refinement, and optimization using AWR Microwave Office. The 
                            workflow was divided into four key phases: Input Matching Network Design and Optimization, 
                            Output Matching Network Design and Optimization, RF Choke Design and Optimization, and 
                            Final Design Synthesis and Optimization. Each phase involved iterative verification and 
                            measurements to ensure optimal performance. Once individual sections were complete, the 
                            circuits were integrated, fine-tuned, and synthesized into the final amplifier design.
                        </p>

                        
                        

                    </div>

                

                

                    
                    <div class="home-content info">
                        
                        

                        <p> The matching networks were designed using distributed elements (transmission lines), 
                            specifically open-circuit shunt stubs. Key design parameters included stability, characteristic 
                            impedance, gain, input matching (source), output matching (load), DC biasing, and radial stubs. 
                            To achieve the desired gain, the transistor was biased using two independent DC power 
                            supplies configured as bias tees (incorporating RF chokes and DC blocks). Surface-mount 
                            capacitors were used to ensure the transistor was DC-isolated. The physical dimensions of the 
                            external components (transistor, capacitors, resistors) adhered to the test jig’s 2.000 × 2.750
                            inch specifications. The final design was exported as a high-resolution Gerber (.gbr) file for 
                            fabrication.

                        <p> The final implementation phase involved assembling all components onto the fabricated 
                            printed circuit board (PCB) and securing it within the test jig. The process began with drilling 
                            holes in the board for fastening to the jig. DC components were soldered into place to properly 
                            bias and align the amplifier. Once the assembly was complete, the board was secured with 
                            screws. Measurements were performed using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to validate the 
                            amplifier’s performance against design specifications. The fully assembled PCB fitted into the jig 
                            is shown in Figure 2.

                        <p> This project successfully demonstrated the design, simulation, fabrication, and testing of an RF 
                            amplifier operating at 3.0 GHz. Using AWR Microwave Office and an iterative design process, 
                            the amplifier achieved the desired gain and stability parameters. Laboratory measurements 
                            confirmed the accuracy of the design, with the final circuit meeting all specifications. The 
                            project underscores the effectiveness of combining theoretical design principles with advanced 
                            simulation tools to produce high-performance RF amplifiers suitable for practical applications.
